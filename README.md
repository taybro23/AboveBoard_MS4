# Overview

Above Board is an e-commerce site used for educational purposes, and I have focused on Skateboarding for the theme of my project. 

You’ll find the essential products you’d need to start or continue skating, from complete decks, trucks and wheels, to t-shirts, hats and skate shoes. The Help & Guidance section provides information on how to start skating, useful links and more!
