## CSS3
All tests passed

## JavaScript
All tests passed

## Python
All tests passed

*Please Note* - Warnings and errors were given on most pages due to template logic being used in this project. Certain Python files also failed PEP8 checks due to base code set by Django.

# Functionality

## Security Testing
All pages were tested with a non-admin account to make sure that no access was given to those users that should not be given. This was tested by me copying the links, accessing them on an incognito browser in Google Chrome that I was not logged into, then logging into it with a non-admin user, and trying the links again. The error pops up correctly and advises the user that only admins and site owners can view that page.

## Responsiveness
The responsiveness of the site was tested using Google Chrome on a windows laptop, Safari on an Apple MacBook Pro, Google Chrome on a Samsung Galaxy S20 and S21, and Safari on an iPhone 13. I found no issues with any elements of the site when testing this.

## General Functionality Testing

### Navbar
-	Navbar is positioned at the top of the screen, and is fixed so that it is visible even when the user has scrolled down the page 
-	All links have been tested and navigate to the correct area of the site
-	When the navigation links are hovered over, they change colour as intended, and the dropdowns appear

-	Overall collapsed layout is consistent with rest of the site
-	Search bar toggle works correctly
-	Site Logo displays on mobile view (bottom navbar) and is correctly hidden when on larger screens

### Navbar Search Bar

-	Buttons on carousel images work correctly and navigate the user to the correct pages, and position correctly depending on screen size

-	Correct sub-category buttons are displayed under each main category, and when the sub-category has been selected, the correct button shows
-	All button effects including hover have been fully tested and work correctly

-	Add To Bag button adds the product to the users shopping bag in the correct size (if applicable) and quantity that the user has selected. This is displayed to the user by way of an on screen alert, showing a mini view of the users shopping bag. This was tested using a range of products with different sizes and quantities selected

-	A checkbox can be ticked that will save the users information for future visits

# Unresolved Issues

I have been incredibly lucky during production and have not encountered many issues/bugs when creating this project. I do however have a few outstanding issues that I am yet to resolve. 

## Product reviews linked to product ratings.

I have implemented product reviews on my site, however I was unable to figure out a way to link these up to display as an average rating for the product the reviews are for. I attempted this by following tutorials but was unable to make this work.

## Product Fixtures.

As I wanted to display each shoe brand separately I created them as separate categories. This made some future developments rather difficult to navigate on my site as I essentially need to rebuild my fixtures, but did not want to edit them at a late stage in my project.
-	Pagination :- This was not something I could implement on Products pages due to the set up of my fixtures. I followed a few tutorials (which successfully worked for my Help & Guidance section) but they were not successful on my product pages

### Keep Shopping buttons.

I would like these buttons to take the user back by one page, but could not find a fix for this.
